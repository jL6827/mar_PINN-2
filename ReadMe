# EnhancedPINN: Thermocline-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Network

This project implements a multiscale PINN model for predicting oceanic and atmospheric velocity fields influenced by thermocline boundary structures.

## Features

- SIREN-based neural architecture
- Dynamic thermocline depth modeling
- Depth-aware correction networks
- Physics residual enforcement (momentum, continuity)
- Directional loss and energy constraints
